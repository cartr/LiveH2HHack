At many companies, employees love to use Slack to collaborate with each other. And LiveH2H provides an immersive video conferencing experience for face-to-face interaction over the Internet. But currently, these worlds are separate; there isn't a good way to use LiveH2H and Slack together.

To help solve this problem, we've created a LiveH2H-to-Slack bridge. Here's how it works:

 - The Slack bridge will join the LiveH2H call on my behalf and post a live transcript of the conversation. [Sang and volunteer talk]
 - I can also contribute to the conversation by posting on Slack. For example, [type "Sounds like a good idea!" and it gets spoken]
 - It even allows bots to chime in â€“ for example, if someone posts a comment on a GitHub issue! [demonstrate this]
 
We see a wide range of use cases for this technology. Users could use it to participate in many LiveH2H calls at once, or to participate in a single meeting if they're in a noisy area where they can't talk. It lets businesses use all of their existing Slack infrastructure and users with LiveH2H's immersive video conferencing experience.
